# Pugs
Pugs is a prototype product mangement system featuring the use of several PHP components. The aim of the project is to have a modular architecture when developing with only PHP components. Over time, any *provider* as what I like to call as a module can be swapped with different adapters. This way, it will lessen the need to alter core related code.
